The main problem with `3D Point Clouds` is that it is sparse & unordered compared to other representations like `2D Images`.

Most 3d `object detection` models approach the problem by
- `Voxel CNN`
  Applying `3D CNN` to voxelized shape
- `Multi-View CNN`
  Render 3D point clouds into 2D images, and apply `2D CNN`
- `Spectral CNN on meshes`
  The mesh can be represented as graph.
  Spectral methods define convolutions using **Graph Laplacian** eigenbasis.
- `Feature-Based DNNs`
  Convert 3D data into vector (extracting traditional shape features), before using dense neural network

All these methods have higher computational costs due to the need to convert from point clouds.
`Spectral CNN on Meshes` does not generalize well.
`Feature-Based DNNs` are highly reliant on extracted vectors.
And all methods suffer from sparseness of 3D data.

Thus, the paper presents `PointNet` which directly learns from `point clouds`.

## Properties of Point Clouds
`Point Cloud` are sparse 3D points, represented with $(x, y, z)$.

Here are the main properties that our `PointNet` neural network must consider.
- `Unordered`
  The points are unordered in 3D space.
  The model must be **invariant** to $N!$ permutations of input points order.
- `Interaction among Points`
  Points in neighbouring sets are related to each other.
  The model must capture local structures from nearby points.
- `Invariance under Transformations`
  Rotating or translating a set of points should not modify point cloud category nor segmentation of points.

## Architecture
`PointNet` is essentially made up of `T-Nets` (transformation networks to handle different transformations and different order of points), `feature extraction MLP` and `Max-Pooling`.

It has one `Detection Head MLP` for object detection.
It has `Feature Extraction MLP` + `Segmenation Head MLP` for point segmentation.

### T-Net
Two key properties of `Point Clouds` that must be considered by the model is to be invariant on
- input point order
- specific object transformations

To achieve this, the `Point Cloud` used `T-Nets` to align the inputs into a `canonical space`, before feature extractions.

- `First T-Net` to make the model invariant for input point order.
- `Second T-Net` to make the model invariant for transformations.
  Note that we use an `L2 Regularization Term` for this since this is on higher dimension.

### Symmetric Function
The end component to each [[T-Net]], as well as the end component of `PointNet`, is to use a symmetric function that yields same outputs for the same points / input features.

The paper considered different symmetric functions like
- `Max Pooling`
- `Average Pooling`
- `Attention Sum`
And it chose `Max Pooling` since it yielded higher accuracy.

### Local and Global Aggregation
For `Point Segmentation`, we need both local & global features.

`PointNet` achieve this by concatenating global features with local features $N \times (1024 + 64)$, before passing it through `feature extraction MLP` and `segmentation head MLP`.

Since the input concatentated feature is aware of both local & global, the output from the `MLP` is also representative of local & global.

### Why separate backbone and head
So, you can pre-train `backbone` (feature extraction `MLP`) + `classification head` first.
We use `classification head` since its easier to classify.

Then, you can either **freeze** or **fine-tune** (with lower LR) the `backbone` when you train `backbone + detection/segmentation head`
