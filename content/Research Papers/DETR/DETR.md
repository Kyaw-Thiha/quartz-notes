`DETR` is an end-to-end model that leverage transformers to remove hand-crafted preprocessing methods.

Most prior models use [[Region Proposals]], [[Window Centers]] and [[Research Papers/DETR/Set Prediction/Anchors]] to predict objects and learn from them.

All of these methods require additional handcrafted preprocessing layer like [[Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS)|NMS]] which add computational cost during inference.

To solve this, there has been prior models that also use [[Bipartite Matching]] but they also require additional handcrafted components.
Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) have also been considered, but they are autoregressive, and hasn't been tested on large datasets.

To solve this issue, `DETR` apply a specific [[Bipartite Matching]] algorithm for better learning, and propose a novel architecture built with a ResNet backbone, and transformer stacked on top of it.

## Bipartite Matching
The model has a fixed number of 100 predictions per image.
These model undergoes [[Bipartite Matching]] whereby a $100 \times 100$ cost matrix is computed through [[Matching Cost]], and used for matching through [[Hungarian Algorithm]].

These the loss of these matched pairs are computed through [[Hungarian Loss]], which is used to updates the neurons.
